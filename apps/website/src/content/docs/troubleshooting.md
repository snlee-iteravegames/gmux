## Dashboard doesn't open / "gmuxd is not running"

`gmux` auto-starts `gmuxd` on first run. If the dashboard doesn't appear at [localhost:8790](http://localhost:8790), `gmuxd` may have failed to start.

**Check the log:**

```bash
cat $(gmux daemon log-path)
```

Common causes:

- **Port already in use** — something else is on port 8790. Change it in `~/.config/gmux/host.toml` (`port = 9999`).
- **Config file error** — gmuxd refuses to start with unknown keys or invalid values. The log will say which key. See [host.toml reference](/reference/host-toml/#strict-validation).
- **`gmuxd` not in PATH** — `gmux` looks for `gmuxd` as a sibling binary first, then in `PATH`. Make sure both are installed together (e.g. via `brew install gmuxapp/tap/gmux`).

**Start manually to see errors immediately:**

```bash
gmuxd run
```

This runs the daemon in the foreground so you can see errors directly. Use `gmux daemon start` for normal background operation.

## Sessions don't appear in the sidebar

- **No project configured.** gmux discovers session groups but doesn't add them to the sidebar automatically. Click **Add project** in the empty state, or the **Manage projects** button. Unmatched sessions show a badge count on the manage button.
- **Session exited immediately.** If the command exits before gmuxd discovers it, it won't appear. Check if the command works when run directly (outside of `gmux`).
- **Different daemon.** If you have multiple gmux installs (e.g. Homebrew and a dev build), `gmux` and `gmuxd` might not be talking to the same instance. Run `gmux daemon status` to check which binary is running.

## "outdated" badge on a session

After updating gmux, sessions that were started with the old version show an **outdated** tag. The session still works, but the runner binary doesn't match the daemon. Kill and relaunch the session to pick up the new version.

## "Connection lost, reconnecting…" / terminal goes blank

- **gmuxd restarted.** The browser reconnects automatically when gmuxd comes back. If the terminal stays blank, refresh the page.
- **Network interruption** (remote access). The SSE event stream reconnects within a few seconds. If the terminal doesn't recover, the session's runner process may have exited while disconnected.
- **Laptop sleep/resume.** The browser re-establishes connections on wake. Give it a moment; if sessions are missing, gmuxd may have been stopped by the OS.

If the banner remains, check the daemon from a normal host shell:

```bash
gmux daemon status
cat "$(gmux daemon log-path)"
```

Do not start a second foreground daemon just because a sandboxed command reports `operation not permitted`. A sandbox may be unable to access the daemon's Unix socket even while the daemon is healthy. Current gmux releases refuse automatic startup on permission errors and other ambiguous failures; they only auto-start when the socket is missing or has no listener.

gmuxd also takes a singleton lock before discovery and never blindly unlinks an existing daemon or runner socket. If the log reports that another gmuxd owns the lock, use the existing daemon or stop it deliberately with `gmux daemon stop` before restarting it.

## Ctrl+V pastes `^V` instead of clipboard

This happens when the keybind system isn't intercepting the key. Possible causes:

- **Focus is not on the terminal.** Click inside the terminal area first.
- **Browser extension conflict.** Some extensions (Vimium, custom shortcut managers) intercept keys before gmux sees them. Try disabling extensions.
- **Using an iframe embed.** Clipboard API requires a [Permissions-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Permissions-Policy) header when embedded in an iframe.

## Copy doesn't work (Ctrl+Shift+C or Cmd+C)

The clipboard API requires a secure context: either `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or HTTPS. If you're accessing gmux over plain HTTP on a LAN IP, the browser blocks clipboard access. Use [Remote Access](/remote-access) (Tailscale provides HTTPS) or run via `localhost`.

## Remote access issues

See the [Remote Access troubleshooting section](/remote-access/#troubleshooting) for Tailscale-specific issues (device not appearing, certificate warnings, hostname resolution).

## Updating

It's safe to update gmux while sessions are running; they reconnect automatically. gmux checks for new releases in the background and notifies you in the dashboard sidebar and when you run `gmux` with no arguments.

After updating, the old daemon is replaced automatically:

- **Homebrew**: the postflight hook restarts the daemon during install
- **`curl | sh` installer**: restarts the daemon if it was running
- **Manual installs**: the next `gmux` invocation detects the version mismatch and replaces the daemon

To force a restart manually: `gmux daemon restart` (or just `gmux daemon start`, which replaces any running instance).

Existing runners keep their conversations and continue running across a daemon replacement. They may show an **outdated** badge until each session is relaunched with the new `gmux` binary; see [the outdated session note](#outdated-badge-on-a-session).
