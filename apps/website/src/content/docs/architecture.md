## Runtime pieces

### `gmux` — session runner

One per session. It:

- Launches the child process under a PTY
- Owns the live session state (title, status, working flag)
- Persists PTY output to an on-disk scrollback file for session replay on reconnect
- Exposes the session on a Unix socket (metadata, events, terminal attach)
- Relays supported reverse-control requests to an active agent hook without writing commands into the PTY
- Runs adapter logic over child output

`gmux` is the source of truth for a live session.

### `gmuxd` — machine daemon

One per machine. It:

- Discovers live runner sockets (`/tmp/gmux-sessions/*.sock`)
- Subscribes to runner events for live updates
- Watches adapter session files (e.g. pi's JSONL conversations)
- Serves the REST API, SSE event stream, and WebSocket proxy
- Serves the embedded web frontend as a SPA
- Manages session launch, kill, dismiss, resume, and supported agent metadata changes
- Optionally connects to other gmuxd instances (peers) and aggregates their sessions into a single UI (see [Multi-Machine](/multi-machine/))

`gmuxd` is stateless — if it restarts, it rediscovers running sessions. On startup it hashes the `gmux` binary it ships with; sessions running a different build are marked **stale** so the UI can flag them.

`gmuxd` acquires a non-blocking singleton lock before it performs discovery or cleanup. It must own both daemon listeners before it scans runner sockets, and it removes a socket only when the operating system proves that no listener owns it. Permission failures, timeouts, and other ambiguous probe errors preserve the socket. These invariants prevent a sandboxed or concurrently started daemon from unlinking the live daemon or runner sockets.

`gmux` auto-starts `gmuxd` only when the daemon socket is missing or refuses connections. It deliberately refuses automatic startup when health cannot be verified, such as an `EPERM` result from a sandbox. If a reachable daemon from an older version is detected, `gmux` automatically replaces it so the child process always talks to a compatible daemon.

Configuration lives in `~/.config/gmux/host.toml`. See [Configuration](/configuration) for the full file layout, or [Security](/security) and [Remote Access](/remote-access) for details on those topics.

### Web UI

The frontend is built with Preact and xterm.js, compiled into a static bundle, and embedded into the `gmuxd` binary via `go:embed`. No separate web server or Node.js runtime is needed. It renders session state as a pure projection of the backend, see [State Management](/develop/state-management) for the data flow details.

### Shared client packages

`gmuxd` consumes its own public API for peer connections. Two small internal packages hold the protocol primitives:

- **`sseclient`** decodes Server-Sent Events from `/v1/events`. It handles `event:` / `data:` / `:` comment framing, enforces payload size limits, supports a configurable idle timeout (sliding read deadline), and calls a user-supplied handler per event. Reconnect is the caller's job, matching how the browser's `EventSource` works.
- **`apiclient`** is a typed wrapper around the public gmuxd API: `GetHealth`, `ForwardAction`, `ForwardLaunch`, `DialWS`, `ProxyWS`, plus `Events` which returns a configured `sseclient`. It sets bearer auth once and accepts an `http.RoundTripper` so peer traffic can route through an alternative transport such as `tsnet`.

Peer daemons use these packages to talk to other gmuxd instances. There are no peer-only endpoints: if the browser path works, the peer path works, because they both flow through the same code. Read limits, auth, error handling, and keepalive live in one place instead of being duplicated per consumer.

## Data flow

    subgraph runners ["gmux (one per session)"]
        r1["gmux -- pi"]
        r2["gmux -- pytest"]
        r3["gmux -- make build"]
    end

    d["gmuxd"]

    subgraph clients ["browsers"]
        b1["desktop"]
        b2["phone"]
    end

    r1 -- "Unix socket" --> d
    r2 -- "Unix socket" --> d
    r3 -- "Unix socket" --> d
    d -- "HTTP / SSE / WS" --> b1
    d -- "HTTP / SSE / WS" --> b2
```

Each `gmux` runner exposes its session on a Unix socket. `gmuxd` discovers these sockets, subscribes to each runner's event stream for live updates, and proxies everything to the browser. When you click a session, the browser opens a WebSocket that gmuxd proxies to the runner's socket, so terminal I/O flows end-to-end.

Pi session renaming travels in the reverse direction: the browser sends `PUT /v1/sessions/{id}/name`, the owning daemon forwards it to that runner, and the runner delivers a session-file-scoped control request to the injected Pi extension. The extension calls `pi.setSessionName()` and acknowledges Pi's canonical `pi.getSessionName()` value before the HTTP request succeeds. No `/name` text is injected into the PTY. Extension-instance and session-file checks reject stale requests during reload or conversation switching; the UI also hides the action for a runner built from an older gmux binary. See [the runner hook protocol](https://github.com/gmuxapp/gmux/blob/main/docs/runner-hook-protocol.md) for the internal wire contract.

## Scrollback replay

Two distinct mechanisms back replay, and they should not be conflated:

- **On-connect emulator snapshot** — the runner keeps a virtual terminal (line-bounded, ~2000 lines via `SetScrollbackSize`) of the live session. When a browser connects or switches sessions, the runner sends this snapshot so the terminal shows the session's current state immediately. Screen clears reset the emulator, and TUI frame boundaries are detected so replay starts at a clean frame. This snapshot lives only while the runner is alive.

- **Persisted on-disk scrollback** — the runner also appends raw PTY bytes to an on-disk scrollback file (`packages/scrollback`). This is **not a ring buffer**: it's an append-only active file that rotates when it exceeds `MaxBytes` (1 MiB). On rotation the active file is renamed to `scrollback.0` and a fresh active file is opened, so total on-disk usage is bounded at `2 * MaxBytes` (2 MiB). Because it lives on disk, this scrollback survives runner exit and serves post-mortem replay for dead sessions.

## API surface

Served by `gmuxd` on a Unix socket (local IPC) and a TCP listener (default `127.0.0.1:8790`, token-authenticated):

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/sessions` | List all sessions (tooling/scripts; the web UI uses SSE snapshots instead) |
| `PUT /v1/projects` | Replace project list |
| `POST /v1/projects/add` | Add a discovered project |
| `PATCH /v1/projects/{slug}/sessions` | Reorder sessions within a project (partial-reorder merge) |
| `GET /v1/frontend-config` | User settings + theme (from JSONC files) |
| `POST /v1/launch` | Launch a new session |
| `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/kill` | Kill a session |
| `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/dismiss` | Kill + remove |
