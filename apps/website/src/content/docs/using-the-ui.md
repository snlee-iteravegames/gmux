description: What you see in gmux and how to work with it.
---

Running `gmux open` opens the dashboard in a dedicated browser window. You can also navigate to **[localhost:8790](http://localhost:8790)** directly; the first time you'll need to authenticate by visiting the login URL from `gmux auth`.

## The sidebar

The left panel lists your sessions grouped into projects. On desktop, drag its right edge to resize it. Focus the edge separator to resize with **Left/Right**, jump to the minimum or maximum with **Home/End**, or double-click it to restore the default width. gmux stores the chosen width in this browser. Touch layouts keep the fixed slide-out sidebar instead.

### Logo

Click the **gmux** logo at the top of the sidebar to return to the home screen.

## Home screen

The home screen shows your hosts, projects, and quick-launch buttons.

### Host cards

Each machine (local and remote) gets a card with a status indicator, session count, and launch buttons.

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------||
| **Green dot** | Connected, sessions visible |
| **Pulsing dot** | Connecting to peer |
| **Red ✗** | Peer disconnected (shows error reason) |

Hosts you add via **Settings → Hosts → Connect to host** persist across restarts and reconnect automatically. gmux does not auto-discover tailnet machines — adding one is an explicit, token-authenticated step (see [Multi-Machine](/multi-machine/) and [ADR 0008](https://github.com/gmuxapp/gmux/blob/main/docs/adr/0008-peer-authentication-via-token.md)).

In **Settings → Hosts**, each host shows an explicit status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Online** | Connected and authenticated |
| **Connecting…** | Handshake in progress |
| **Auth needed** | Reachable, but the token is missing or wrong — an **Add token** button pre-fills the connect form so you can supply it |
| **Offline** | Unreachable right now (shows the connection error); it reconnects on its own when the host comes back |

Removing a host also clears the project references that pointed at it, so it leaves nothing behind under **Referenced but not found**.

**Upgrading to 2.0:** hosts you had projects on — that earlier versions auto-discovered on your tailnet — are migrated into the roster as **Auth needed**. Click **Add token** on each and paste its token (run `gmux auth` on that host) to bring it back online. Other tailnet machines aren't carried over; re-add them with **Connect to host** if you want them. Your `projects.json` is backed up to `projects.json.bak` before the upgrade rewrites it.

Connected peers show launch buttons for each configured adapter, just like the local host.

### Projects

Sessions don't appear in the sidebar until you add a project. The first time you open the dashboard, click the **+** button to launch a session. gmux creates a default "home" project that catches sessions started from your home directory. As you work in more repositories, use **Manage projects** to organize sessions by repo.

Click a **project name** to open the [project hub](#project-hub), an overview of all sessions in that project grouped by host and working directory. The active project is highlighted in the sidebar.

Each project has **match rules** that determine which sessions belong to it. Rules can match by filesystem path (`~/dev/gmux` and its subdirectories) or by git remote URL (grouping clones across machines). See [`projects.json`](/reference/projects-json/) for the full reference on rules, precedence, and advanced options like exact matching and host scoping.

You can manage projects at any time via the **Manage projects** button at the bottom of the sidebar. A badge shows when there are running sessions that don't match any project yet. The modal has two sections:

- **Your projects**: configured projects with their match rules. Drag to reorder, click **×** to remove.
- **Discovered**: directories with running sessions that don't match any project. Type to filter, or enter a path to add directly.

### Sessions

Each session has a dot on the left edge:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Pulsing ring** | The tool is actively working (building, thinking, running tests) |
| **Blue dot** | New output you haven't seen yet (viewing the session clears it) |
| **Muted ring** (brief) | Transient terminal activity, fades after a few seconds |
| **No dot** | Idle or waiting for input |

Agent sessions (pi, Claude, Codex) only trigger the blue unread dot when the assistant completes a turn, not on every line of output.

For a reachable, live Pi session on the current runner build, hover over its title to reveal the **pencil** button. Enter a new name and press **Enter** to save it through Pi's own session API; press **Escape** or move focus away to cancel. This changes the actual Pi conversation display name and the sidebar title, but leaves the session slug and bookmarkable URL unchanged. Dead sessions, other adapters, unreachable peers, and sessions still running an older gmux build do not show the button. Restart or resume an older runner with the current gmux build before renaming it.

Hover over a session to reveal the **×** button. This dismisses the session: live runners are killed, the sidebar/project membership is removed, and persisted runtime metadata is dropped so the session does not come back as resumable. Use **Resume** from a dead session view only when you want to continue it.

## Project hub

Click a project name in the sidebar (or navigate to `/:project`) to see the project hub. This is an overview of every session in the project, grouped first by host, then by working directory.

### Host sections

Each host gets a section with a status indicator and a breadcrumb path showing the topology chain. For example, a devcontainer running on a remote peer might show `workstation › alpine-dev`. Status indicators:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Accent dot** | Local host |
| **Green dot** | Connected remote peer |
| **Pulsing yellow dot** | Reconnecting to peer |
| **Red dot** | Peer disconnected |

### Folder rows

Within each host, sessions are grouped by their working directory. Each folder row shows a path label and the session cards underneath. A **+** button on each row lets you launch a new session in that directory on that host.

### Session cards

Each card shows a status dot and the session title. Click a card to attach to that session's terminal. The **×** button dismisses the session, killing it first if it is still alive.

### Empty projects

If a project has no sessions yet, the hub shows the project's configured path with a **+** launcher to get started.

## The terminal

Click a session to attach. You get a full interactive terminal powered by [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/). Colors, cursor positioning, mouse support, and images all work. The header bar shows the session title, status label, and a working indicator.

### File previews

Local file paths printed by a session are clickable. Markdown, text/code, PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP files open in a read-only preview over the terminal; paths such as `src/main.ts:42` also focus the referenced line. Closing the preview returns to the live terminal without disconnecting it.

For safety, gmux only reads regular files inside the session's working directory or workspace root. It does not execute files, render raw HTML or SVG, or follow paths that escape through `..` or symlinks. File preview from remote peer sessions is not supported yet. Web URLs and OSC 8 hyperlinks keep opening in a browser tab as before.

## Launching sessions

### From the command line

```bash
gmux -- pi              # coding agent
gmux -- pytest --watch  # any command
```

### From the UI

There are several places to launch:

- **Sidebar header**: click the **+** button at the top of the sidebar to launch in the default directory.
- **Sidebar project**: hover a project name to reveal a **+** button. This launcher is context-aware: it targets the host and directory of whatever you're currently looking at. Select a session on a remote peer, and the **+** targets that peer. Switch to a local session, it targets local.
- **Project hub**: click the **+** on any folder row to launch in that specific directory on that host. For projects with [peers](/multi-machine), the per-host launcher routes the session to the correct machine.
- **Home screen**: quick-launch buttons for starting a session without any project context.

All launch menus show the available adapters (Shell, pi, Claude Code, Codex). The first item aligns with the **+** button so a double-click launches the default adapter instantly.

## URL routing

Every view has a stable URL:

| URL pattern | What it shows |
|-------------|---------------|
| `/` | Home: host status, projects, quick launch |
| `/:project` | Project hub overview |
| `/:project/:adapter/:slug` | A specific session's terminal |

For example, `/gmux/pi/fix-auth-bug` links directly to a pi session in the gmux project. URLs update as you navigate, work with browser back/forward, and are bookmarkable. Session slugs remain stable across kill and resume.

## Keyboard shortcuts

gmux ships a complete default keymap. Keys not listed here go straight to the terminal.

### All platforms

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Shift+Enter** | Sends a plain newline (`\n`) instead of Enter |
| **Ctrl+C** | If text is selected: copy to clipboard. Otherwise: sends SIGINT |

### Linux / Windows

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Ctrl+Shift+C** | Copy selection to clipboard |
| **Ctrl+V** | Paste from clipboard |
| **Ctrl+Shift+V** | Paste from clipboard |
| **Ctrl+Alt+T** | Sends Ctrl+T (browser steals Ctrl+T) |
| **Ctrl+Alt+N** | Sends Ctrl+N (browser steals Ctrl+N) |
| **Ctrl+Alt+W** | Sends Ctrl+W (browser steals Ctrl+W) |

### Mac

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Cmd+C** | Copy selection to clipboard |
| **Cmd+V** | Paste from clipboard |
| **Cmd+A** | Select all terminal content |
| **Cmd+Left** | Home (beginning of line) |
| **Cmd+Right** | End (end of line) |
| **Cmd+Backspace** | Delete to start of line (sends Ctrl+U) |
| **Cmd+K** | Clear screen (sends Ctrl+L) |

All defaults can be overridden or disabled in [`settings.jsonc`](/reference/settings/#keybinds-guide).

:::note[macCommandIsCtrl]
If you prefer every Cmd+character to send its Ctrl equivalent (Cmd+A = beginning of line, Cmd+K = kill to end, Cmd+R = reverse search), enable [`macCommandIsCtrl`](/reference/settings/#maccommandisctrl).
:::

:::tip[App mode]
`gmux` tries to open in Chrome/Chromium `--app` mode for a standalone window with full keyboard access. If it falls back to a regular browser tab, shortcuts like Ctrl+T, Ctrl+N, and Ctrl+W are intercepted by the browser. The Ctrl+Alt workarounds in the table above cover this case. You can also install gmux as a PWA from the browser menu (⋮ → Install gmux).

## Mobile

Open the same URL on your phone (or via [remote access](/remote-access)). The sidebar slides in from the left (tap ☰), and a bottom bar provides keys that phones don't have:

| Button | Sends |
|--------|-------|
| **esc** | Escape |
| **tab** | Tab |
| **ctrl** | Arms Ctrl for the next key (tap ctrl, then c = Ctrl+C) |
| **alt** | Arms Alt for the next key |
| **← →** | Arrow keys (hold to repeat) |
| **▶** | Send (Enter) |

When **ctrl** is armed, the toolbar transforms: **esc** and **tab** become **↑** and **↓** arrow keys, **▶** (send) becomes **paste**, and **← →** switch to word-jump navigation. The toolbar returns to normal after the next keypress or when you tap ctrl again.
