/**
 * xterm's WebGL renderer rasterizes each glyph into a texture atlas the first
 * time it's drawn and caches it; it does not re-rasterize a cached glyph when
 * a web font later becomes available (this build has no `loadingdone` hook).
 *
 * Our Nerd Font icon fallback loads lazily — the @font-face carries a
 * unicode-range, so the browser only fetches the ~490 KB woff2 once an icon
 * glyph actually appears in the output. That ordering is the problem: the
 * first icon can be rasterized as tofu *before* the font bytes arrive, and the
 * tofu stays cached until something clears the atlas (a resize or font change).
 *
 * This bridges the gap. When the icon font finishes loading we clear the atlas
 * once, forcing every cached glyph to re-rasterize against the now-available
 * font. We deliberately do not *trigger* the load (that would defeat the
 * lazy/unicode-range optimization for text-only sessions) — we only react to
 * it. If the font is already loaded (another terminal pulled it in, or the user
 * has the full Nerd Font installed) there is nothing to fix and we no-op.
 *
 * Returns a disposer that detaches the listener.
