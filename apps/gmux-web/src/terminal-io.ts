  //      the user's pre-redraw distance from the bottom. Loses the
  //      identity of the line they were reading but keeps their intent
  //      ("N lines above the latest content").

  // \x1b[3J resets ydisp/ybase to 0 mid-frame, breaking the line-
  // tracking invariant that the else branch's adjustedY relies on. A
  // shrinking baseY is one symptom but not the only one: pi can also
  // emit \x1b[3J followed by a long redraw that grows baseY past its

 *
 * The restore target for a match at `y` is therefore `min(y, baseY)`:

 *   - visible-region match (`y > baseY`): viewport snaps to the bottom
 *     and the anchor sits somewhere inside the visible region, still
 *     readable.
 *
 * Tiebreak by closeness to the pre-wipe `distanceFromBottom`. Multiple
 * visible-region matches all collapse to the same target (`baseY`)
 * with the same restore-distance (`0`); among scrollback matches we
 * prefer the one whose `baseY - y` is closest to the captured
