// Package snapshot composes the wire payloads for the protocol-2
// SSE stream defined by ADR 0001.
//
// The protocol has two snapshot kinds plus one bare event:
//
//   - snapshot.sessions  full list of owned sessions (replaces the
//     per-event session-upsert / session-remove
//     stream of protocol 1).
//   - snapshot.world     bundle of projects, peers, health, launchers
//     (replaces projects-update / peer-status).
//     Not sent to peer consumers.
//   - session-activity   bare {id} ping; lossy, not coalesced.
//
// Snapshots are composed lazily at emit time by a per-kind coalescer
// (see internal/coalesce); this package only knows how to assemble
// the payload from already-fetched inputs. Callers (the SSE handler
// in main.go) decide what to read from where and pass it in.
//
// This split keeps composition free of locks and HTTP plumbing, so
// the wire shape can be exercised in isolation.

// peer status).
//
// The fields are typed `any` because their concrete types live in
// packages this one shouldn't depend on (projects.Item,
// peering.PeerInfo, peering.LauncherDef, the /v1/health map). The
// caller marshals them through; SSE clients see normal JSON.

// hostname, tailscale, version, peers (offline-merged), session
// counts, runner_hash, etc. We re-emit it on each snapshot rather
// than splitting it across fields because it is intentionally an
