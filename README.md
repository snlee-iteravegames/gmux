# gmux

**Keep tabs on every AI agent, test runner, and long-running process across your machines. Work from your desktop, steer from your phone.**

Launch any command as a managed session. gmux gives you a live, interactive terminal for each one — grouped by project, with real-time status updates pushed to your browser. When an agent needs input, you'll know. When tests fail, you'll see it. Switch to your phone and the same view is there, ready for you to course-correct.

No Electron, no desktop app. Just a browser and two small binaries.

## Install

```bash
brew install gmuxapp/tap/gmux
```

Or download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gmuxapp/gmux/releases).

## Quick start

```bash
gmux -- pi                 # launch a coding agent
gmux -- pytest --watch     # launch a test watcher
gmux -- make build         # or literally any command
gmux open                  # open the UI
```

Open `localhost:8790` — all three sessions are there, grouped by project, with live status indicators. Click one to attach a full terminal. The same xterm.js that powers the VS Code terminal, running in your browser.

The daemon (`gmuxd`) starts automatically on first use. There's nothing else to set up. For daemon commands, run `gmuxd -h`.

## How it works

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Per session"
        gmux1["gmux\nPTY · WebSocket · adapter"]
    end

    subgraph "Per machine"
        gmuxd["gmuxd\ndiscovery · cache · proxy"]
    end

    subgraph Browser
        web["gmux-web\nsidebar · terminal"]
    end

    gmux1 -- "Unix socket" --> gmuxd
    gmuxd -- "HTTP · SSE · WS" --> web
```

**`gmux`** wraps any command in a managed session. It allocates a PTY, serves a WebSocket for terminal access, and runs an **adapter** that understands what the child process is doing. Built-in pi, Claude Code, and Codex adapters report working, idle, error, and unread transitions; any child can publish a richer label through `PUT /status`. A generic command gets alive/dead/activity tracking out of the box. With no arguments, it opens the UI in your browser.

**`gmuxd`** runs once per machine (auto-started by `gmux`). It discovers runner-authoritative sessions via their Unix sockets, caches their state, proxies WebSocket connections, and pushes real-time updates to the browser via SSE. Runtime sessions are rebuildable after a restart; project configuration, peer metadata, and bounded scrollback remain persisted.

**`gmux-web`** is the browser UI. The sidebar groups sessions by working directory, with status dots that pulse when something needs attention. The terminal is xterm.js — the same battle-tested terminal emulator that powers VS Code's integrated terminal — with synchronized output for flicker-free session switching and bounded persisted scrollback (up to roughly 2 MiB per runner) that replays on reconnect.

```

Sessions are grouped into **folders** by working directory. Each folder heading is enriched by **probes** — lightweight observers that report git branch, dirty state, open PRs, or anything you script. The folder's status dot reflects the most urgent session inside it.

## Features

### Sessions
- **Launch anything** — `gmux -- <command>` wraps any process in a managed session
- **Full terminal** — xterm.js with WebSocket transport, the same terminal emulator as VS Code
- **Workspace file previews** — click local Markdown, text/code, or image paths in terminal output to inspect them inside gmux without executing files
- **Bounded persisted scrollback** — up to roughly 2 MiB per runner replays on reconnect and remains available after runner exit
- **Flicker-free switching** — DEC 2026 synchronized output renders session swaps in a single frame
- **Session lifecycle** — live status, exit codes, kill from the UI
- **Reconnecting** — tab away and return to the live terminal with bounded history replayed when a reconnect is needed

### Adapters — session-level intelligence
Adapters teach gmux how to work with specific tools. They're compiled into the binary and selected automatically by command name.

- **Auto-detection** — `gmux -- pi` recognizes pi and activates the pi adapter. No flags needed.
- **Rich status** — built-in agent adapters report working, idle, error, and unread transitions; children can publish custom labels such as test or build results
- **Child awareness** — any tool can self-report status via `PUT /status` on `$GMUX_SOCKET`, no adapter required
- **Graceful fallback** — unknown commands get the shell adapter

### Probes — directory-level intelligence
Probes run on the gmuxd that owns each working directory and enrich local or remote folder headings with project context.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Folder: ~/dev/myapp"
        git["git probe\nmain · 3 files changed"]
        pr["github-pr probe\nPR #42 open"]
        s1["Session: pi\n● thinking"]
        s2["Session: pytest --watch\n● 47/47 passing"]
    end

    git --> heading["Folder heading\nmyapp — main · 3 changed · PR #42"]
    pr --> heading
    s1 --> dot["Aggregate status dot"]
    s2 --> dot
```

- **Git** — branch name, dirty file count
- **GitHub PR** — PR number, status, clickable link
- **Script probes** — drop an executable `.sh` file in `~/.config/gmux/probes/`; gmux runs it with a bounded timeout and accepts one JSON object containing `label`, `value`, optional `status`, and optional HTTP(S) `url`

### UI
- **Triage-first sidebar** — within each folder, unread sessions come first, then errors, working sessions, and idle or resumable sessions
- **Automatic folders** — unstamped sessions sharing a normalized workspace root (or cwd) on the same origin host group automatically, without changing `projects.json`
- **Selected-session header** — contextual metadata and actions stay visible for the selected terminal
- **Mobile responsive** — the same scoped URL works on desktop or phone for selecting a session and sending input
- **URL scoping** — `?project=myapp` and `?cwd=/path` filter the existing session view and remain bookmarkable
- **Near-black dark theme** — neutral black surfaces with Nord Frost and Aurora accents, plus locally bundled Inter UI and JetBrains Mono terminal typography

### Architecture
- **Runner-authoritative** — gmux is the source of truth, gmuxd is a rebuildable cache
- **No external dependencies** — no tmux, no screen, no abduco. Two Go binaries and a web app.
- **Web-first** — works on desktop, tablet, phone. Same URL everywhere.
- **Zero config** — run `gmux -- <command>`, open a browser
